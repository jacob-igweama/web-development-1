The <meta charset="utf-8"> is a HTML tag that declares the character encoding for a specific web page.
Character encoding defines how characters are represented as binary data, which is fundamental for web browsers to interpret and display text correctly.
It is a local encoding i.e it only applies to the individual HTML document where it is placed.
The inclusion of this tag(<meta charset="utf-8">) within the <head> section of an HTML document signals to the web browser, the encoding format being used, facilitating proper rendering of text in various languages and character sets.
It requires less processing by the browser as it is a more lightweight and efficient method of specifying the character encoding.
It helps the web page display text in multiple languages and special characters correctly.
It is advised to always set your text editor to save HTML files as UTF-8 to ensure consistency.
Some key reasons why it is important are:
1. it has a universal character support; it represents virtually all characters from all writing systems worldwide.
2. helps with search engine optimization; helps improve visibility of content in search engine rankings.
3. helps with accessibility; it enhances accessibility by accommodating text in different languages and special characters.
