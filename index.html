<h1>Brief Introduction</h1>
<body>
 Hello everyone, I am jacob Igwe-ama. 
 I am a graduate of Geology and exploration geophysics from Ebonyi State University.<br>
 I chose to register and join the upskill program on web development because I know IT would be the most important sector in societal infrastructure in the future.
